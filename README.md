# phantomjs-builds
A repository for the sole purpose of holding on to historical builds of phantomjs.

We have the following builds:
* [phantomjs-linux-x86_64-2.2.1](https://github.com/BIGjuevos/phantomjs-builds/releases/tag/v2.1.1)
* [phantomjs-linux-x86_64-1.9.8](https://github.com/BIGjuevos/phantomjs-builds/releases/tag/v1.9.8)
* [phantomjs-linux-x86_64-1.9.7](https://github.com/BIGjuevos/phantomjs-builds/releases/tag/v1.9.7)
* [phantomjs-linux-x86_64-1.9.1](https://github.com/BIGjuevos/phantomjs-builds/releases/tag/v1.9.1)

We use releases because GitHub has a really [nice release binary policy](https://help.github.com/articles/distributing-large-binaries/).
